To be honest there isn't that much to tell about this walk. It's just a good walk to get out of the house for a few hours and take my mind off things.

Normally when I do this walk I come back the same way I went, however this time I decided to do a more circular route, as it takes longer! The way there is all bridleway, so very flat and easy going, there are usually a fair few dog walkers and cyclists around and today was no different.

On a day like today, Glasson Dock is a lovely place to have a chill out, the sun was glistening off the surface of the water, and there were a few boats/canoes milling around in the dock. I had a sit down on the edge for a while trying to get certain things out of my mind.

I have come back this alternative route once before, and it was horrendous! However that was in winter with no suitable kit/supplies, so I thought this time would be much better. I actually really enjoyed the walk back in the end. You walk along the canal all the way back to Lancaster for about 5/6 miles. It wasn't all that busy and the biggest drama I had was a nesting Swan had put itself in the middle of the path, so I had to basically run around it as it tried to peck me on the way past, I know they are The Queens bird, but in my experience they are vicious pests.

Due to the walk back, this has probably been my longest walk in terms of distance, and it's a great one to keep in mind for the rest of Summer.
