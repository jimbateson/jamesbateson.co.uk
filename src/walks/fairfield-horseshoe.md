Fairfield is visible from pretty much all of the walks I have done this week. I have been looking over to it each day, and not once have I seen the top. So I knew the visibility wasn't going to be great going up. I had been doing some research for the walk and people had warned that the top can get quite confusing in thick mist. However compared to yesterdays unsuccessful walk, I do know this route rather well, so felt much more confident attempting it.

There is plenty of road walk ascent to start the walk, which is just to prepare you for what is to come, the walk shouldn't be underestimated, it's quite an undertaking. As you head up past the UCLAN campus you come toward Low Sweden (I'm not sure where the bridge is from here sorry, I will find it one day!). You then begin an ascent up into the hills towards Low Pike.

It soon became clear that I wasn't going to be able to see a lot on this walk. As I got past Low Pike and towards High Pike as I was yesterday, I was surrounded by thick fog. Luckily on the way up to Fairfield, there is one simple rule for 90% of the way, just stick to the wall on your left. There is one area that can be particularly bad for bogs, however after navigating this, it's pretty straightforward walking.

The walk is split into a few mini-summits, Low Pike, High Pike, Dove Crag, Hart Crag and then onto the Fairfield Summit. Along High Pike, there was still evidence of heavy snowfall in the previous weeks, but plenty of space to avoid it. As you get onto Dove Crag and Hart Crag the walk opens up somewhat, and you lose the guiding wall. There are a couple of rocky climbs that you need to be careful on. I was having to check my route and bearing quite often as it all looks very similar and it's easy to lose track where you are.

I see what people mean about it being easy to get off track on the summit of Fairfield in the fog. There is a fairly obvious path, but there's quite a steep drop either side. Keep on a southeast bearing will and you will start heading back down.

The walk back ins really easy going in my opinion, and seems to go really quickly! As I start to drop down, the fog started to lift, and I got some great views over Grasmere and back to Ambleside. As I mentioned in a previous walk write up, you come back on Nab Scar and Heron Pike, which I had not realized until I climbed them separately a couple of days ago!

Coming down Nab Scar is actually just as tough as going up. Your knees really aren't in the mood for all those steps by the time you get to the end.

At the bottom, I took a piece of flapjack left by a local for weary walkers. I'm not sure if I'll eat it, to be honest, I'm quite suspicious about it!

I also stopped off again at the Rydal Hall tea room, which had been a favorite spot over the course of the week in this area. I am so glad that I decided to do this walk despite the poor visibility, It's hard work at the start on the way up, but I find it a really rewarding walk, and you end up doing quite afew fells and Wainwrights too. I will definitely be returning in the Spring/Summer when the weather is better and I can appreciate the views as well as enjoying the walk.
