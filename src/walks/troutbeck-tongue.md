This is the route that we had planned to do back in January, but decided against due to the wintery conditions. All I can say is that I am glad we did that day, as this was a hell of a walk.

As I mentioned last time we did this, the way up Wansfell Pike this route takes you is really brutal to start. I find walking up constant climbs of steps really hard. To start with the weather couldn't decide what it wanted to do. I had rain, wind, hail and then sunshine. This actually helped a bit as it gave me excuses to stop and swap some layers around.

The conditions by the time I got to the summit of Wansfell Pike were actually quite nice, good views available all around, which is quite rare for when we go up Wansfell, normally can't see a thing. This won't be the last time I do Wansfell this year, so after a few pictures and some water, I marched on, knowing I had a long long way to go.

Turning left at the gate before the Wansfell summit, I followed the lane on along to where we turned back last time. From this point on, I was solely relying on the directions/map of the route I was following. What became clear right away as I headed towards Baystones, was that this was going to be a very boggy walk. Although there was no rain, the week before had been very wet, so there was a lot of groundwater around. There were some clear paths were other walkers have navigated around, so I stuck to those.

I actually thought things were going quite well when I reached the summit of Baystones, again there were some nice views of the Lake Windermere.

The next part of the walk was where things went slightly downhill. After a short walk over some well-pathed moorland type terrain, my route seemed to suggest I needed to take a right turn, however, there didn't seem to be a well-marked path, so I went off piste and headed for the general area I needed to be (the crossing of a road). It should have been a sign of things to come that I completely stacked myself trying to get over a gate, this is when I met the sheep.

> I think I'd just happened to stumble upon carnivorous sheep.

Normally when you approach sheep in a field, they kind of look at you, and scamper off, however, these absolute weapons seemed more interested, they started following me, initially from a distance, but then I noticed they started to run at me from behind! I initially thought with it being the lambing season, I might have intruded and they may be protecting lambs, but there were none to be seen, I think I'd just happened to stumble upon carnivorous sheep.

To anyone driving on the road I was heading for, it must have provided them with great entertainment. Me bounding across a field, trying to avoid bogs where possible, with 20-30 sheep closely following me at full speed. I luckily reached the gate that led onto the road and practically Olympic hurdled in. What was clear was that from this point, there was no turning back.

After crossing the road, following the route didn't really get any easier. I'm not sure if it was the weather that had turned paths into running streams, or the guy's idea of a path was a bit different o mine, but I just couldn't find right way at all. I had to cross a 'stream' that after all the rain was more like a raging river! This took me out of the way for a while as I had to find a safe crossing point. More wandering around, then led me to a bridge to cross another stream and I could finally see the ascent to Troutbeck Tongue. I looked back and could still see the road I had crossed, clearly and I had been walking for what felt like an hour.

However finding this bridge to cross had improved my mood, as I finally felt I'd found the path and that it would now be a formality up to the summit. Wrong. Again I just got totally off route somehow, I was met by a barbed wire fence, with no sign of a gate. By this point, I was pretty fed up, so just threw my bag and coat across and jumped the fence. Again I was totally off-piste, but I could see the top so just headed in that general direction, such a steep slope up to the summit, a very hard walk. When I got to the top, I just wanted a Kit-Kat and cry.

The view from the top was good, towards Troutbeck and Lake Windermere in the distance, however not a good as I'd hoped, this could have just been my lack of appreciation for anything at that point though!

To make matters worse, my phone battery was very low, and I needed it to navigate to Troutbeck! Once I got to where I knew where I was, as the Wansfell Pike walk we normally do passes through there.

However, I needn't have worried, as when I go to the bottom of Troutbeck Tongue, there was a public footpath signposted all the way to Troutbeck village. Probably a couple of miles, or flat easy walking and I arrived in Troutbeck, from here it was just the case of heading back on the normal Wansfell route and back to Ambleside.

I'm sure one day I will back on this walk with fondness. However today is not that day, I am tired and sore (multiple falls and gate stacks) and ready for a rest before tomorrows walk. I'll maybe keep that a bit shorter!
