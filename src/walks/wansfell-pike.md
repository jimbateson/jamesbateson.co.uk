The original route we had planned to do for the day, had us start at our normal car park in Ambleside, it's a real pity there are no National Trust ones there, as it's really expensive! We summitted Wansfell Pike a number of times last year, however, this route took us up the way we normally come down and it's safe to say it wasn't as enjoyable.

We normally walk back along Lake Road over Jenkins Crag, make our way to Troutbeck and then ascend Wansfell from there, this gives you a chance to stretch the legs and get nice an warm before hitting the hills. However this time, from the car park we were virtually straight into hill after hill, and within 5 minutes ascending up Wansfell!

Progress was SLOW. Not only was it the first major walk of the year with the hangover of Christmas still looming, but we have both recently started running, so the legs were not as fresh as normal. As we got about half way up we turned around to be greeted with some wonderful views of the snow-covered Fairfield Horseshoe, poking above some low hanging cloud. The further up Wansfell we got, the more snow that started appearing, and towards the very top, some snow spikes would not have gone a miss!

After probably the worlds worst snowball fight we reached the top. It felt strange having summited so early, with the majority of the walk left to do. With that in mind, we took in some stunning snowy views, skipped a brew at the top (wind chill also picked up a lot) and headed down.

As we got off the summit, there is a gate that leads to the final ascent (the way we normally go) here our route had us turn left, rather than go all the way down to Troutbeck. We had intended to do a large circular route (about 12 miles) which took in Baystacks and Troutbeck Tounge. However, after proceeding along this route for a short while, our winter walker instincts kicked in. We didn't have any full winter walking gear, it had taken us longer than anticipated to do Wansfell Pike, and we had a lot of new route walking ahead. With that in mind, we decided to turn back and leave the full route until a better day with more daylight hours.

A highlight of our Wansfell walks last year was tackling Nanny Lane, lane doesn't really do it justice as it is, in fact, a steep, never-ending unforgiving hill (especially hard on a hangover I have been informed). So it seemed a little bit of a cheat heading down it rather than up and wasn't quite the same somehow. As we got to the bottom and headed through Troutbeck the weather vastly improved, the sun was out, definitely Michael fleece weather. We stopped for a brew in the village, with some nice views and then headed back along the path we normally start the walk from, with some splendid views of Lake Windermere helping us over the line.

I think next time we do Wansfell Pike we will stick to the normal way around. However, with the full route of this walk still needing to be done, we are going to have to tackle the tough start at least once more!
