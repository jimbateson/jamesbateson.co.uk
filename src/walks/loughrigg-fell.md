summary: After a week off last week to run a 10k, this week I was back with a walk that I am very fond of. I used to do this walk a lot with my grandparents when I was younger, and also had a very special first date here! So at the end of all that I thought it fitting to go back to where it started.

The weather seems to be improving! This weekend has been much better than recent weeks, and a great excuse to get up to The Lakes, when Spring/Summer comes, I'm hoping it will become my second home and I'll be up most weekends. I've been having a tough time recently, with personal stuff and also work pressures, so I decided to force myself to get out for the day, hoping I could take my mind off things.

With me now being limited to public transport, a mixture of buses and trains, it means I only have a select area I can choose walks from currently. I am thinking about getting a little runaround to be able to get further afield, but there are a few logistical hurdles I need to jump before that can become a reality.

Anyhow, this week I decided to return to Rydal Water (nr Grasmere), as mentioned in the intro this is a walk with sentimental value to me, and it's also a great walk, that can be done in a couple of hours, meaning it works around the transport times.

My walk started, as so many do, in Ambleside, you can start this walk from a couple of car parks closer to Rydal Water, however, there is a nice little path just off the road (A591) that will take you to the start of the walk, and it adds some bonus steps on!

It actually brings you out at one of the said car parks, and from there you're only a 5-minute walk from seeing Rydal Water. As I had arrived a little later than normal, the routes were very busy with families, meaning many of the photo opportunities were already in use. In fact, when I reached the caves, there was a queue to get over the stepping stones and in! This was a bit of a shame, as one of the highlights of this walk is going into the cave itself, so I paused for a moment here to do some layer management and move on.

The initial ascent up Loughrigg is pretty tough going, there are obvious pause points as you get up, so it's good to break the ascent up into little stages, bursts of climbs and then turn to see a beautiful view of Rydal Water and Grasmere and on towards Keswick.

The summit of Loughrigg has always been a busy little hub every time I have been up, and today was no different. There are always people taking photos from various angles, and many selfies, then asking others to take photos of them, so I always try and get a couple of photos and get out of there. From the trigg point you can see over to Lake Windermere and also have a great view of another favorite walk Elterwater.

Normally at this point, I would descend the way I had come up and walk back along Rydal Water shoreline, however with it being so busy and fancying something new, I decided to take a slightly different way back to Ambleside across Black Mire and Deer Hows. This led me along a maze of paths (maybe a couple of wrong turns) and eventually back down onto the path running adjacent to the A591 I started on.

I hadn't seen the sun much all day, however as I walked back into Ambleside it came out, and it was actually quite pleasant a warm. As a little bonus the bus I caught back to Windermere was open top, so I enjoyed a quite warm scenic trip back to the station, after another quick trip to Lakeland and a lovely chat with a woman about drying clothes effectively, I headed back to Lancaster.

It was another great walk, and lovely to get a little bit of sun in The Lakes. I kind of feel like I am rushing around these walks a bit, not fully appreciating the views and peace and quiet, do to pressures in getting back from bus/trains. So hopefully I can sort some alternate transport in the near future.
