We did Arnside Knott a couple of times last year, on both occasions taking slightly different routes. As mentioned above, we had intended to do Fairy Steps the last time we did it, however, due to time constraints and fading light, we decided against it (as yet again I took us slightly off the route!). As I got the train today, and the path towards Fairy Steps was not far from the station, I decided to tackle this first.

The first part of the walk takes you across some pretty boggy fields, not helped by yesterdays heavy rain. I can see why we kind of got lost last time, there are signposts dotted around, however, the paths are not too well defined, after getting a little further than we got last time, I got slightly lost, luckily there was a kind dog walker passing who pointed me in the right direction!

    <p class="lg:flex-1 lg:mr-6">The actual Fairy Steps walk was fairly easy going in the end. There was a sharp incline through some woods, but before long I had found the famous steps. The first thing that struck me was that they were VERY narrow! And upon starting my ascent of them, it soon became clear that I would not get far up them with my large backpack on. So I had to hold this above my head and walk up! Must have looked a bit bizarre, luckily there was nobody around whilst I did it.</p>

After reaching the top of the steps, there wasn't a lot to see in all honesty, so I continued along the route which took me circular around some woods. Upon reaching the end of these woods, a 20 minute or so walk along some roads and bridleways brought me back to the start of the Fairy Steps walk.

I then headed back on myself to the train station road, straight across from where I had started, was the road up to the start of the Arnside Knott walk. These hills were immediately harder after the relatively flat terrain of Fairy Steps. In all honesty, I feel that I kind of rushed the Arnside Knott walk, I had a train time that I was aiming for, so I kind of flew up and down.

Most of the walk is fairly easy going, so I was able to plow on, however the final ascent up to the summit is tough going, as gets quite steep quickly, I took a quick snap of the furry cows we always see on the way up, and also at the trig point (no planking this time!).

For me, the best view to be seen is from the other side (see the walk preview image). So I took a quick trip around there to get that snap. I did spot a bench that I was tempted to have a brew on, however, a couple snaffled it before I got there. This worked out well due to my train times anyway, so I set off down back to the station. It's an easy walk down, and I didn't need to stop and wipe my feet on a cemetery wall, so made my way straight back to the station.

All in all, it was quite an easy going walk, but I really enjoyed doing one we had not done before and seen some new places. Now I know the route, hopefully, we can return together soon and I can show Natalie Fairy Steps, so we can officially tick it off the list!
