summary: This is a my first post for a few weeks sorry! Been having a few perosnal issues recently, so been keeping under the radar. This week I've dcided to get away to Ambleside for a few days. Mainly to clear my head and think over things, as part of the process, do some walks I've been meaning to do for a while. So although I also did this walk in my last post, it's the first in a series of 5, I just re-did this as a familiar one after I had checked into my hotel.

As mentioned above, this walk is a repeat of the last walk I wrote about on here, so I will keep this short and sweet!

Having just checked into my hotel early, I need to get out of their way as they finished my room off, so I dropped my bags off and headed for a route I know and love. I knew this would take me pretty much the exact amount of time the hotel needed, so it made perfect sense.

The weather was a lot better than expected actually, so the walk from Ambleside to Rydal was almost just t-shirt weather. However as I proceeded around Rydal, the sunshine disappeared and was replaced by rain showers and cloud. The last time I was here (also on a Sunday) it was absolutely packed with families, however, it was extremely quiet today! I even stopped for lunch halfway up Loughrigg and saw nobody walk past.

One of the bonus points of the walk not being as busy, was the fact that the caves were quieter, so I could hop across the stepping stones and in for a wander around. This was a nice bonus as one of my favorite parts of this walk is going into the cave.

As ever there were a few people milling around the summit of Loughrigg, but not as busy as usual. There were some great views towards Elterwater and Grasmere.

After taking the views in I headed back down the same way as last time, not back down to Rydal but across some crags.

A brief walk back to Ambleside and I found myself back at my Hotel, I checked in properly and rested up ready for the week of walking ahead!
