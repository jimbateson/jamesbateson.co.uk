The route I had found for the walk was only a few miles long. But I had heard that the views were pretty spectacular from the top. The start of the walk is only a 2-minute walk from the train station, marked by a lovely sign.

As with most walks in this area, the start of it was quite steep, mainly road walking, and then turned into a windy wood walk. You could already start to get a glimpse of the views over Lake Windermere.

As most of the routes I'd see for this walk had detailed you are up on the top of Orrest Head within 1-15 minutes, and wow the views did not disappoint! Complete panoramic views taking in the lake, over towards Ambleside, the Scafells in the distance, absolutely lovely. There was a handly placard type sing thing, handily telling you what all the hills you could see were. Being a weekday it was pretty quiet at the top. So I took in views for a while, before moving ion.

I had picked a route that took me on a circular, as I prefer that to head directly back on myself. This took me off the other side of the summit, a small section of field walking and I came to a farm. The walk back towards Windermere was mainly road walking, however, interestingly, I did find a public footpath that went onto Troutbeck. This would be a good addition to a loop of Wansfell in the future!

I then arrived back into the wood I had started to walk off at, then back on the main road. I had a quick walk into Windermere hoping to pick up some lunch and probably my favorite little cafe ever Homeground however I seemed to have caught it at lunch rush hour :( so all tables were taken.

Instead, I had some lovely Cod Tacos at the Lakeland cafe, before having a look round the shop and getting my train.

All in all a very quick walk, but with stunning views. A bonus was the find of the footpath to Troutbeck, meaning I will most certainly be returning to this walk in the summer.
