summary: Unfortunately, I had to turn back on this walk :( I do not know the route at all and visibility was terrible. I started losing the path and therefore decided that the safest option was to turn back and save this one for better weather!

I could tell as soon as I set off for this walk that it would be a struggle. Having read up and tried to understand the route the night before, I had my reservations about doing it with the visibility as bad as it was. However, I thought I would give it a crack, and see if the fog lifted as I went.

The start of the walk was in the opposite direction to all the walks I have done around the Ambleside area. And the initial climb was a windy road walk, aptly named "The Struggle" and it lived up to its name for sure, a good 15 minutes of a continuous steep climb was tough on the top of the legs. Even as I climbed this road and turned off onto the footpath, I turned around to see that Ambleside had completely vanished behind the thick low hanging fog.

The small percentage of the walk that I did do was mainly spent avoiding bogs, there was actually nothing to see. I couldn't see anything in front of me, or anything behind. So I spent most of my time stopping to check I was still on route and heading in the right direction!

I got to the bottom of the main ascent, and the path seemed to end, I do not like it when I can't see where I have come from, or where I am going. Especially not knowing the walk, I could have walked miles off track and ended up in trouble. Although I was absolutely gutted, something just didn't feel right about going on, I do not have the navigation skills to get safely get around in poor visibility and this seemed like the safest option.

As I headed back down, it did seems the fog was slightly lifting, however, I still think I made the right decision on this one. I am however determined to get back and do this walk when the weather improves, so watch this space for an updated hopefully full route write up.
