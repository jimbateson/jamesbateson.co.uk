summary: We often just see Windermere and Bowness as the gateway to The Lakes and apart from the traditional Lakeland stop we just drive through. So I thought I'd give a walk around these parts a go, and I wasn't disappointed.

Rather than start this walk from Bowness as the route suggested, I started from Windermere train station, this admittedly added around 3 miles to the walk, with the trek down Lake Road to get to Bowness.

When I initially found this route, I was quite apprehensive about walking it. There were mentions of lots of farms, which I get nervous walking through, as I am never sure if I am supposed to really be there, however, it soon became apparent that it was very well signposted where the private roads were.

As all of our walks seem to do, the start road was a huge hill! As I started to climb the snow also started to fall. This had been forecast and neither of these hills was really high so I wasn't too worried about, however it did start getting quite hard and there was a good amount already on the ground. The ascent to Brant Fell was virtually straight after the first road, and I paused at the bottom to sort out some winter equipment!

As well as putting the rain cover over my bag (first time used - this would prove to be lifesaver at the end of the walk!) I also saw this steep ascent up to the summit as the perfect chance to try out the [boot spikes](https://www.trespass.com/clawz-ice-grippers?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-srO_IKg4AIVRrTtCh3AwAqwEAQYASABEgLY6vD_BwE#color=Black&size=EACH) which at &pound;6.99 proved to be a great deal, as they performed SO well. I had great grip walking up the snowy hills and lanes, and felt confident descending on fresh snow as well. Although they are not full on crampons you would need for something more challenging in these conditions, I would highly recommend them for walking like this, they saved me a lot of time slipping around, and also potential injury!

In all honesty, there was not a lot to see at the top of Brant Fell due to the conditions, so I moved straight on towards School Knott. It soon became clear that I was following part of the 'Dales Trail' which I didn't even know existed before today (something to add to the pipe dream list), this was well signposted and took me on a combination of wood trails, road and country lane walks, all quite easy going.

    <p class="lg:flex-1 lg:mr-6">As I headed towards the ascent of School Knott, I found quite a funny note somebody had written in the snow. Soon the snow turned to rain and everything started to get a little 'slushy' so on went the waterproof trousers and I started towards the summit. Although steep it was a very short blast to the top, however, unfortunately, the work was for little reward as there was even less to see at the top :(, there was a small tarn, however, this was completely frozen over!</p>

On the way back to Bowness, the rain started to get even harder, and yet again most of my waterproof gear failed me, which is annoying, especially my coat as I paid quite a lot of money for it (Trespass), however it's now had me totally soaked twice, same goes for my normal trousers (which are only shower proof) and my waterproof overtrousers. The only bit that managed to stay dry was my feet. My Berghaus boots are brilliant, and I think with walking gear, paying a bit more does often have long term benefits, so I think I may need to look at replacing my setup with something better.

On getting back into Bowness, I still had the trek back to the train station to do :( I was also absolutely soaked through. Luckily I made it back with plenty of time before my train, so I went into Lakeland and got changed in the toilets, after my last experience getting soaked and having to get the train back, I had a full change of outfit ready, thanks to my backpacks rain cover, this was all nice and dry, so I felt much better after that.

Obviously, I couldn't just leave Lakeland, so made the obligatory purchases of daily shower cleaner and cling film, then caught the train and enjoyed a few brews which my hands had been too cold to make on the way around. I had a great time on this walk, the winter conditions made it really fun. With public transport from Lancaster very limited to The Lakes at the weekend, staying in the Windermere and Bowness area in the future is something I may do more of!

On a side note, check out the shape created by the walking route I took, it kind of looks like a dog on a lead I think (open to interpretation!).
