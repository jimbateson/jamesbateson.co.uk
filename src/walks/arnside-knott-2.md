One of my biggest concerns before I set off was that I would see Natalie there, with the guy she has started seeing, so I was a bit apprehensive as I really do not want to/am not ready to see that yet.

I arrived at Arnside slightly later than planned, and probably didn't start walking until 1 pm ish. Unlike the last time I did this walk, I decided to do Arnside Knott first, and the Fairy Steps last. As I walked from the train station through Arnside, it was very busy with tourists, which I kind of expected, lots of people had taken to the beach. The sun was beating down so lucky I had remembered to put the suntan lotion in.

As I was doing the Knott first, I needed to make my way up the hill to the start, this was a nice little warm up. I was worried that the walk was going to be really busy considering how many people had been around in Arnside and that this is a relatively accessible walk for some stunning views. However as I made my way up to the summit I hadn't really seen that many people, and there were only a few at the top.

The views were wonderful, what I like to call an HD day. You could see for miles out so clearly. Around the other side of the Knott, I had a sit-down and a brew on a bench overlooking the sea, you could see Heysham power station in the distance.

After taking the view in and soaking up some sun for a while, I headed down the Knott to the main road into Arnside. A short walk along here towards the train station brings you to the road that leads to the Fairy Step route I took last time. This route was pretty straightforward, so I decided to go with it again.

After crossing the railway line, you cross a couple of fields before reaching Carr Bank. As a crossed the next fields I saw a load of caravans and tents. Turns out that is used by a caravan club at certain times during the year. I was actually quite jealous of them all sat outside in the sun with their beers!

As I started the route up towards Fairy Steps I topped up on some more suntan lotion as the heat felt like it had upped a couple of degrees (22 my phone was telling me!). As with last time the Fairy Steps was very enjoyable and easy going. Again as with the Knott, it was very quiet, I'm guessing a lot of people probably hit The Lakes to take advantage of the weather.

The Fairy Steps themselves were just as narrow as I remember them, and I again had to hold my bag above my head to get through them! The woodland/road walk back to Arnside was again very pleasant and easy going.

This time I carried on and walked back into Arnside. I got some lovely fish and chips and had a walk along the beach before heading back.

A lovely day for walking and a very pleasant walk. getting out and about and taking my mind off things is so important to me at the moment, so this was exactly what I needed.
