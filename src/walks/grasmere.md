summary: After yesterdays tough walk, I wanted something a bit easier going today as my legs as feet were still feeling. However this did end up being a bigger distance than first anticipated, it was much easier going, and probably one of my favourite walks so far.

I had researched this walk after wondering what the hill was you can see from Rydal Water (caves and Loughrigg Walk). I found a route that went from Ambleside to Rydal, took in Nab Scar, went along to Heron Pike (I later realized these were part of the Fairfield Horseshoe walk) and then down into Grasmere. I would then be taking The Coffin Route back to Rydal.

As a few of my walks required this week, I started by taking the path from Ambleside to Rydal. This is great a ease in and warm up for walks, nothing too strenuous, but it does get the legs going. It also gives you a great view of the Horseshoe walk (although not too great with this low cloud this week).

After making my way to the start of the Rydal Water walk, I instead made my way across the small turning bridge and along the road to Rydal Hall, this is where I have finished the Horseshoe walk in the past, hence it all started to make sense.

The ascent up Nab Scar was pretty tough, much like the ascent of Wansfell Pike I have done the last couple of times, it's a lot of steep steps, that seem to go on forever! At the top, there are some nice views to be had of Ambleside, Lake Windermere, Rydal, Loughrigg and Grasmere, although there were some wisps of low hanging cloud around, I could still see where I was heading.

Heron Pike was a short walk along from Nab, although a couple of steep climbs made things tough on the legs after yesterday! and there were even some small patches of snow. This was the part of the walk I was unsure about, as on the route I was following it looked as though there was no path down from Heron Pike to the main road to Grasmere, and sure enough, although I initially found one, I soon realized I was going off-piste and half running down some steep moorland!

I eventually ended up at Alcock Tarn, which was lovely and peaceful, so I stopped for some refreshments and to plan the rest of my route. From here it was all well pathed, and I ended up winding my way down through a nice wooded walk. At the bottom of this road was the start of the coffin route back to Rydal, however, the main purpose of me walking to Grasmere was to get some famous gingerbread so on I went.

A very short walk along the main road from Town End and you're into Grasmere. It's a lovely little village, and very popular with tourists, even midweek. I got the gingerbread I had been after (the shop is very small and I took up most with my bag) and I then had a walk around the churchyard next to the shop and visited the Wordsworth Graves.

Retracing my steps I then found my way back to The Coffin Route. Although the name sound ominous, it's actually an old corpse road they used to carry people along for burial at Grasmere. The route is pretty easy going and you're essentially adjacent to the road next to Rydal Water at all times. You end up coming back out at Rydal Hall, where I stopped for a coffee at the tea room there.

The walking route I had chosen was only supposed to be about 5 and a half miles, however with the extra walks from Ambleside to Rydal, and then also into the center of Grasmere I ended up with around 10 and a half. However it was a great walk to get the legs going after yesterday and it's also given me a couple of ideas for routes in the future, which I am very much looking forward to.
