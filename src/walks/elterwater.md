The last time we had been to Elterwater, much of the walk back to the car had been underwater, so were hoping for a slightly dryer run. The forecast was giving a fine day, however when we set off from Lancaster around 8:30 it seemed like there might a bit of rain around.

	<p class="lg:flex-1 lg:mr-6">Another good thing about this walk is the fact the car park is National Trust, so we get free parking. However, it does also mean that it can get very busy! so getting there nice and early is advised to beat the queues that can form into the carpark, and also never underestimate how long somebody is willing to sit in their car staring at you, to hurry you to leave and get a park! We actually signed up to our National Trust membership in this car park, with a guy who's normally there every time, however, today our man wasn't there.</p>

The walk itself starts off very steady, a windy path meanders around before bringing you to the side of Elterwater itself, there are some great views out towards the Langdales from here, which look particularly spectacular when there is some snow on the tops.

A short walk from the water, you come to a waterfall, I'm not entirely sure of the name, to be honest (I think it may be Aria Force), here you can walk down and get pretty much right next to it, which is pretty cool. Although not advised if it is particularly forceful, as you can get quite wet with the spray!

Once you're past the waterfall it can mean on one thing. [Chesters by the River](https://www.chestersbytheriver.co.uk/index.html). This quaint little cafe has a lovely selection of cakes and teas/coffees (perfect brew stop), and also a little shop selling many artisan wares. We have actually made a point of collecting things from here. Natalie has a collection of postcards they sell here with other famous Lakes walks on. They also sell some (Bone China) mugs, a little bit more of an expensive souvenir, but hey. So the rule is, once we have done the walk, we can buy the merch.

Once you leave Chesters, it's a little bit of road walking, the road always seems like spaghetti junction when you want to walk on it, so just make sure you keep in the side and stop to give cars plenty of space to pass. At the top of the hill you get back onto the path and can either head back to Elterwater and the waterfall there (Teddie approved) or as we normally do, take the long way back.

> ...to this day we have never seen another soul in there, it could be a figure of our imagination for all we know.

It's a pretty easy route to follow, a few steps and stiles and you're then back onto the road, you can then walk along this back to the car park, taking a wood path to avoid the road, although look out for the murder cabin in the woods style shack. We usually do a loop of a wood before we had back along this road. I have no idea what it's called, and to this day we have never seen another soul in there, it could be a figure of our imagination for all we know.

Once back at the car park, you can either as previously mentioned pack your things, get started out by somebody waiting for a park, or have a drink and some hot food at The Brittania Pub, opposite the car park. Would highly recommend the sausage sandwich!

All in all a cracking walk, and still one of our favorites, that we will no doubt return to many times this year (I think it was our highest single walk count last year).
