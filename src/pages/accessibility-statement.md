I'm committed to making this site as accessible as possible to the widest possible audience. To do this I'm always looking to improve the site and adhere to available and relevant guidelines, standards, and principles.

I have built this site to conform to the level Double-A level of the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

I have built this site using valid and semantic HTML and CSS that complies with W3C guidelines. The site should work in most current browsers and future iterations should also display it correctly.

You should be able to:

* change colours, contrast levels, and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver)

When adding content I also aim to make this text easy to understand.

Whilst I make every effort to adhere to the guidelines mentioned earlier in this statement. This is not always possible, particularly in the case of any third-party content I may have to include.

I am continuously checking and auditing this site for accessibility issues and trying to improve areas that may not be up to the standard they should be. If you should find any accessibility issues with this site, or struggle to access any features of it [please don't hesitate to contact me](mailto:jim.bateson@outlook.com).

This accessibility statement was created and published on the 9th of January 2022.
