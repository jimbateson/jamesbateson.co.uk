I'm committed to making this site as accessible as possible to the widest possible audience. To do this I'm always looking to improve the site and adhere to available and relevant guidelines, standards, and principles.

I have built this site to conform to the level Double-A level of the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
