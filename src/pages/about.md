I’m James, a front-end developer living and working in Lancaster for [Fat Media](https://www.fatmedia.co.uk/). I've been building for the web since 2013 and most enjoy working with HTML and CSS.

From building a stats website for my 5-a-side team in school, I gained a real passion for designing and building for the web. I graduated from Leeds Beckett (then Metropolitan) University with a degree in Multimedia Technology. Alongside building up my web design/development skills, this course gave me the chance to try lots of disciplines in media.

I see myself very much being on the 'front of the front-end' and love building accessible, responsive layouts and UI/UX interactions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as trying to recreate print layouts on the web with modern layout features such as CSS grid.

## Skillset

Tools/software/languages I have used during my development career, and use frequently.

* HTML
* CSS (Sass preprocessor - scss)
* JavaScript (jQuery & vanilla)
* VSCode
* WordPress
* Umbraco
* Drupal
* Task runners (Grunt & npm scripts)
* Git (gitflow)
* Zeplin

## I’m currently learning...

Whether it be an online course or a physical book, I'm always trying to add to my skillset.

* Vue.js
* Electron

## It’s not all about the codes

Outside of work, I like to try and keep active, I have become a very keen runner over the last year or so, regularly attending local Parkruns and 5/10K/half marathon events.

As well as running, I also enjoy getting my walking boots on and going for a hike, especially up in The Lake District fells, occasionally getting the bike out and also going to the gym.

If (when) the weather isn't ideal for getting outdoors, I'll be in the kitchen trying with varying degrees of success to rustle up some good food.
