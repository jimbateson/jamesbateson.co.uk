With a background in design, I'm now focused on the front-end and especially enjoy programming with HTML and CSS.

After discovering my passion for building on the web at school when building a website for my five-a-side team, I have over 5 years of experience in creating performant, accessible user experiences and have worked with clients such as Lakeland, Warburtons, and YOTEL.

Day-to-day I use modern front-end techniques to solve a multitude of problems efficiently. Aided by tools such as task runners, linters, and frameworks. Writing code cleanely and having repetitive tasks become automated are things that I strive for.

## It’s not all about the codes

Outside of work, I like to try and keep active, I am a very keen runner, regularly attending local Parkruns and 5/10K/half marathon events and more recently trail/fell runs.

As well as running, I also enjoy getting my walking boots on and going for a hike, especially up in the Lake District fells, occasionally getting the bike out and also going to the gym.

If (when) the weather isn't ideal for getting outdoors, I'll be in the kitchen trying with varying degrees of success to rustle up some good food.
