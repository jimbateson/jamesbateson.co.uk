I'm James, a front-end developer living and working in Lancaster for [Fat Media](https://www.fatmedia.co.uk/). I've been building for the web since 2013 and most enjoy working with HTML and CSS.

From building a stats website for my 5-a-side team in school, I graduated from Leeds Beckett (then Metropolitan) University with a degree in Multimedia Technology. This course gave me the chance to try lots of disciplines in media, however, I found my passion to be in web design and development.

I see myself very much being on the 'front of the front-end' and love building accessible, responsive layouts and UI/UX interactions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as trying to recreate print layouts on the web with modern layout features such as CSS grid.

## Skillset

Tools/software/languages I have used during my development career, and use frequently

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (jQuery & vanilla)
* VSCode
* WordPress
* Umbraco
* Drupal

Outside of work, I like to try and keep active, and love going for runs (you'll find me between Lancaster and Morecambe Parkrun most weeks), walking in The Lakes, or trying out a new recipe.
