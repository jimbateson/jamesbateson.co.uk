As side projects go, this is probably up there with the most pointless and niche. However, it was a good exersise in building something from scratch using some modern ES6 features.

## Project Background
As anyone from Lancaster will know, every Wednesday and Saturday the street market comes to town, bringing an eclectic mix of stalls selling crafts, local produce and food to go. The pick of these food stall is without a doubt the halloumi and falafle wrap stall, affectionality known as 'Veggie Man'.

However, there's nothing more dissapointing in life that walking to the market, only to find that he's not here that week. So this site aims to help you avoid that crushing feeling by pre-empting whether he'll be there or not on that day.
