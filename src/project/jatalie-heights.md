As mentioned on my [about page](/about/), IÊ¼m a keen walker, and love to get up to The Lakes. This project is somewhere I can document these walks, and reflect on enjoying the great outdoors.

## Project Background

This project was originally setup with a regular walking partner, however, unfortunataly that is no longer a thing, so this has become my personal walking blog.

Its main purpose it to document walks I have been on and create a list of walks that I'd like to do.

Admittedly this project has fallen a little stale, however, it was a great chance to build my first site using a static stite generator  [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) - which I then went on to use building this very site!

## How does it work?

The site builds Nunjunks templates and markdown files into HTML files. The Nunjunks templates are responsible for the layouts of the pages, and the markdown files are the content (walk posts for example).

The site has a couple of 'collections', The Walks and The List. these are walks that I have completed and have written a post about, and walks that I aim to do in the future.
