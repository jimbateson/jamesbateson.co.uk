Tabs are a common component featured on websites and apps, and fairly easy to implement. However, how accessible are your tabs? Do they provide the correct screen reader support, keyboard controls and handle a no-javascript experience gracefully? Maybe not, in this article, I'll go over how I went about considering these things in a recent build.
