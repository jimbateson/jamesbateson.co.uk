Whilst investigating some accessibility audit feedback for a client at work recently, I was required to do some research into what makes the aria tab pattern fully accessible. I learned a lot and thought it would be useful to document these for my future self.

## The problem
What was wrong?

<div class="post-note"><h3>Must read</h3><p>Links to ARIA authoring practice and inclusive components.</p></div>

## aria-selected

## role="tab"

## Arrow key behavior

## Focus behavior

## Tabindex
