I've always tended to prefer the use of the `<section>` element in my markup to separate out the visual 'areas' in a page design. Until fairly recently I thought that it had an implicit semantic meaning/role, however, this doesn't seem to be the case in some circumstances now. But does it mean that we shouldn't still use them?

Let's start with a look at the definition of the element from the MDN Docs:

>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
