My job role has unfortunataly been made redundant recently. The time since, has honestly been a bit of a blur. Lots of emotions that have changed on a daily basis.

Whilst I'm devestated and currently in the shock/fright/realisation of what that means in terms of living and such, I'm trying to not get overwhelmed by it, stay positive and do at least one proactive thing a day.

One thing it's given me a chance to do, is have a think about the direction I want to take my career in, what role would I fit into that would make me happy?

My passions have always been the development fundementals. HTML, CSS and vanilla presentational JavaScript, and over the last serveral way, focusing on accessibility and culture.

Both of the jobs I have had in the digital industry have been 'Front End Dev/Engineer'. However, as the stack has moved on and the role feeling more like 'full-stack', I have struggled as working with frameworks and TypeScript etc has just never 'clicked' for me personally.

From the first few days of looking for job postings however, this has presented a bit of an issue. Almost all positions I saw were React/TypeScript proficient/expert, node.js, npm, headless, unit tests the lists were just huge.

So I've decided to try and rebrand myself in a way that plays to my strengths and gives me the chance to try and speak to companies about a role I feel is hugely important within a development/design team.

## UI Developer and Accessibility Specialist

I don't know if this sounds pretentious, but I feel it best describes what I'm passionate about and where I think my strengths lie.

### UI Developer

By this, I mean building components with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Possibly with them then being integrated by somebody else. Or try and expand on my Vue/React knowledge in this downtime. I truly beleive there is strength and value in a HTML/CSS expert within a team.

Something that I hugely enjoyed in my last position was also encouraging and participating in the design team routines, seeking at new ways to bring the design and development disciplines closer together. As a UI Developer, I feel that would be a great chance to maybe get back into some design work.

### Accessibility Specialist

Accessibility is at the heart of everything I consider important, and over the last several years I have advocated for, and championed implementing accessibility culture, processes, workflows, skillshares and mentoring. 

It is something I would love to keep on doing in my next position. I feel that working on buildin components but also more closely with designs would be a very nice combination, and allow me to make earlier impacts and start communications earlier.

Continuing to talk and write about accessibility is something I would also hope to make part of my new role.

## Personal development

During the search for a new job, I'd like to take the time to also start doing more of what I love in terms of article writing and experimenting with code. Whether this be some tinkering on codepen, finally getting around to making some updates on this site, or trying something a bit different, there are lots of areas I need to improve in, and it's important that I don't try and do too much and take this break to look after my wellbeing also.
