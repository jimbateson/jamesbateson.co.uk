My job role has unfortunnataly been made redundant recently. The time since, has honestly been a bit of a blur. Lots of emotions that have changed on a daily basis.

Whilst I'm devestated and currently in the shock/fright/realisation of what that means in terms of living and such, I'm tryin to not get overwhelmed by it and stay positive.

One thing it's given me a chance to do, is have a think about the direction I want to take my career in, what role would I fit into that would make me happy?

My passions have always been the development fundementals. HTML, CSS and vanilla presentational JavaScript, and over the last serveral way, focusing on accessibility and culture.

Both of the jobs I have had in the digital industry have been 'Front End Dev/Engineer'. However, as the stack has moved on and the role feeling more like 'full-stack', I have struggled as working with frameworks and TypeScript etc has just never 'clicked' for me personally.

From the first few days of looking for job postings however, this has presented a bit of an issue. Almost all positions I saw were React/TypeScript proficient/expert, node.js, npm, headless, unit tests the lists were just huge.

So I've decided to try and rebrand myself in a way that plays to my strengths and gives me the chance to try and speak to companies about a role I feel is hugely important within a development/design team.
