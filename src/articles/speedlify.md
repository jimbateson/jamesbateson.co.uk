Speedlify is a [tool from Zach Leatherman](https://www.speedlify.dev/) that uses Google Lighthouse to benchmark web pages over time. after all if you spend so much time making your site fast and accessible, letâ€™s keep it that way!

In this article I will document how I created my own instance of Speedlify to help monitor performance measurements on this site.

<p class="post-note"><strong>Important Read</strong>Zach has already <a href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/speedlify/">written a great article</a> introducing Speedlify, much better that I could ever hope to. So I'd reccommend reading that first to learn a bit more about the project.</p>
