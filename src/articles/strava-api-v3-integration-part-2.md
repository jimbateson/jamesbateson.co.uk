You can read the [First article here](https://jamesbateson.co.uk/articles/strava-api-integration-part-1/). This details how to set up your Strava app and deal with the oAuth2 setup. In this article, I'll detail how I went about consuming this API and using the data to display my latest 6 activities on this site.
