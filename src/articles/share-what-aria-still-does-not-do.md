I came across this awesome article from Steve Faulkner earlier this week. [A nice explanation on What ARIA does not do](https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2024/07/15/what-aria-still-does-not-do/).

Wanted to add a little note on here so I do not lose it and can refernce in the future.

I particularly liked the following statement, and is something that I have come across being an issue on many occoasions when testing, analysing and remediating accessibility on sites:

> Use of ARIA is a promise you as a developer make to screen reader users.
>
> As long as developers implement ARIA according to its rules of use in HTML and implement interaction patterns (usually via JavaScript) that agree with the standard pattern for a particular role, all is well. When they do not there is grief.
