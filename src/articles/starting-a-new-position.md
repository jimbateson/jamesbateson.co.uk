I have some exciting news to share today. I started a new job â€” as a Front End Engineer at [Code Computerlove](https://www.codecomputerlove.com/) 

Code is a company I have admired for many years now and the chance to work here has been a dream come true.

Naturally, my first day has been a lot of finding my feet and setting kit up, however, I already feel this is a place I can really thrive as a developer and a person at.

Although it was a shame there wasn't everybody in the office, it was great to be in there to collect my kit, it feels like an open, inspiring, and collaborative space that I can't wait to share with some colleagues.

The rest of my week is going to involve getting to know more people, no doubt introducing the hell out of myself and soaking up as much information as I can, and I really cannot wait!
