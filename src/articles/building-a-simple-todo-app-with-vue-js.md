Over the last few weeks Iâ€™ve started to [learn Vue.js](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/vue/), a progressive JavaScript framework. Alongside working through the Frontend Master course, I decided to try and rebuild my very basic todo app functionality with it.

My app (Today) is a simple todo app - often a go to build when starting to learn a new language. I'd started to build it using vanilla JavaScript and Electron. Whilst getting my head around Vue I realised that my core functionality needs would be suited to using Vue for, as some of my JavaScript had started to get a little unweilding.

Today has 4 main actions:

* Display todos
* Add a new todo
* Complete a todo
* Delete a todo

This post will detail how I went about using Vue to acheive each of these.

<p class="post-note"><strong>Note</strong> This post will not go into, or apply any styling to the todo list, or detail any of the Electron implementation (I'll cover those in a further more in depth post once it's all good to go).</p>

Here's the finished Codepen of what I built (see note above about styling etc)

<p class="codepen" data-height="350" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="jim-bateson" data-slug-hash="bGEGmBx" style="height: 350px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Today">

<h2>Creating the Vue Instance</h2>

First thing we need to do is attach Vue to a DOM node

```javascript
new Vue({
	el: '.js-todo-app'
});
```

<h2>Displaying the todos</h2>

For the purposes of this demo, I've used some dummy data, when I integrate this with my Electron codebase, I'll need to read and write from a JSON file.

Vue reads all its data from its `data` object. So in here we define our todos array

```javascript
data: {
	todos: [
	    {
		    title: 'Test todo',
		    completed: false
	    },
	    {
		    title: 'Test todo 2',
		   completed: false
	    }
	]
},
```
