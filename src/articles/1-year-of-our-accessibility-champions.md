Recently at Code, our accessibility champions community celebrated one year since forming. Over this period we've grown to having 21 members in our channel with representation from all of our product teams and disciplines.

As champions our goal is not to police, or dictate accessibility across the Code studio, but to advocate for, raise awareness of, discuss, signpost (towards solutions and resources etc, not do the work for people) and upskill.

## Where we started

The idea of the champions started with myself and another front-end engineer, Leilah. We realised that we had shared passion for the topic and wanted to make real change within the studio.

This is an important part of any company that may wish to start a similar community, finding others that share the passion is key. It doesn't have to be a number of accessibility experts either, and can often be better not to be. A group of experts may become siloed and isolated with their own conversations. However, a goup of people with different skills, in different roles with a shared passion can be a very powerful thing.

Leilah and I started the conversation at a company-wide skillshare we gave during Codes Make Change Friday time. We chose to do an accessibility foundations talk, introducing people that might not have been aware and hightlighting why it's so important. As part of this we called on people who might also be interested to learn more and help drive Code's accessibility commity forward.

From here we set up a Slack channel where people could ask questions on the champions group, and waitied to see how many people would join! We got around 10 in the first week, which was well beyond expectations.

**Tip**: Along with the acessibility champions channel, we also have a general accessibility channel. This is a great idea to encourage people from all disciplines to ask accessibility questions, and there are some great discussions and resources shared on there.

## Setting expectations

At our first meeting, we wanted to outline some expectations around the challenges we might face.

1. Curiosity to learn more about people’s experiences with our products and the wider web
2. Accepting that you don’t know everything and that’s fine. There’s rarely an easy answer with accessibility
3. Patience will be needed to get everybody onboard with our goals and what we want to do
4. Being brave and challenge views and be honest and frank with what’s at stake
5. Being kind to yourself. It’s going to be a long process with obstacles to navigate that may cause friction
6. Accept that it will be a thankless task/job at times. We’re not doing this for a pat on the back

Although this may seem like a negative list for a first meeting. It's important to be transparent about how difficult it can be to make change on this scale within an organisation, it's not an overnight thing, it will be years of commitment and consistency.

## Goals

We also outlines some goals we'd like to hit withing 6 to 12 months. At this stage these were very high level, and have shifted a little since. Some have been met, some made great progress, whilst others have been unacheivable/unrealsitic. Writing this has actually be very interesting looking back at this first meeting presentation!
