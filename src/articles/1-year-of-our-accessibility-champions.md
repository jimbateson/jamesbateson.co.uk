Recently at Code, our accessibility champions community celebrated one year since forming. Over this period we've grown to having 21 members in our channel with representation from all of our product teams and disciplines.

As champions our goal is not to police, or dictate accessibility across the Code studio, but to advocate for, raise awareness of, discuss, signpost (towards solutions and resources etc, not do the work for people) and upskill.


## Where we started

The idea of the champions started with myself and another front-end engineer, Leilah. We realised that we had shared passion for the topic and wanted to make real change within the studio.

This is an important part of any company that may wish to start a similar community, finding others that share the passion is key. It doesn't have to be a number of accessibility experts either, and can often be better not to be. A group of experts may become siloed and isolated with their own conversations. However, a goup of people with different skills, in different roles with a shared passion can be a very powerful thing.

Leilah and I started the conversation at a company-wide skillshare we gave during Codes Make Change Friday time. We chose to do an accessibility foundations talk, introducing people that might not have been aware and hightlighting why it's so important. As part of this we called on people who might also be interested to learn more and help drive Code's accessibility commity forward.

From here we set up a Slack channel where people could ask questions on the champions group, and waitied to see how many people would join! We got around 10 in the first week, which was well beyond expectations.
