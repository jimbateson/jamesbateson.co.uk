Recently at Code, our accessibility champions community celebrated one year since forming. Over this period we've grown to having 21 members in our channel with representation from all of our product teams and disciplines.

As champions our goal is not to police, or dictate accessibility across the Code studio, but to advocate for, raise awareness of, discuss, signpost (towards solutions and resources etc, not do the work for people) and upskill.

## Where we started

The idea of the champions started with myself and another front-end engineer, Leilah. We realised that we had shared passion for accessibility and wanted to make real change within the studio.

This is an important part of any company that may wish to start a similar community, finding others that share the passion is key. It doesn't have to be a number of accessibility experts either, and can often be better not to be. A group of experts may become siloed and isolated with their own conversations. However, a goup of people with different skills, in different roles with a shared passion can be a very powerful thing.

Leilah and I started the conversation at a company-wide skillshare we gave during Codes Make Change Friday time. We chose to do an accessibility foundations talk, introducing people that might not have been aware and hightlighting why it's so important. As part of this we called on people who might also be interested to learn more and help drive Code's accessibility commity forward.

From here we set up a Slack channel where people could ask questions on the champions group, and waitied to see how many people would join! We got around 10 in the first week, which was well beyond expectations.

**Tip**: Along with the acessibility champions channel, we also have a general accessibility channel. This is a great idea to encourage people from all disciplines to ask accessibility questions, and there are some great discussions and resources shared on there.

## Setting expectations

At our first meeting, we wanted to outline some expectations around the challenges we might face.

1. Curiosity to learn more about people’s experiences with our products and the wider web
2. Accepting that you don’t know everything and that’s fine. There’s rarely an easy answer with accessibility
3. Patience will be needed to get everybody onboard with our goals and what we want to do
4. Being brave and challenge views and be honest and frank with what’s at stake
5. Being kind to yourself. It’s going to be a long process with obstacles to navigate that may cause friction
6. Accept that it will be a thankless task/job at times. We’re not doing this for a pat on the back

Although this may seem like a negative list for a first meeting. It's important to be transparent about how difficult it can be to make change on this scale within an organisation, it's not an overnight thing, it will be years of commitment and consistency.

## Goals

We also outlines some goals we'd like to hit within 6 to 12 months. At this stage these were very high level, and have shifted a little since. Some have been met, some made great progress, whilst others have been unacheivable/unrealsitic. Writing this has actually be very interesting looking back at this first meeting presentation!

1. Internal accessibility upskilling
2. Accessibility policy, statement, guidelines, and standards
3. Improving our own offering
4. External accessibility upskilling
5. Offering certain accessibility services
6. Internal accessibility culture – hiring people with disabilities

## Culture over compliance

From the start we realised that none of the goals we set would be acheivable if we didn't have people onboard. Therefore the majority of our first year has been trying to instil an accessible and inclusive culture within the studio.

When thinking about accessibility, the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) are often what is dicussed. Conforming to a certian level can be an imense challenge, and in my opinion without the understanding, empathy and drive of why, it can be the wrong way of thinking.

The guidelines are just that, a great starting point and baseline for build accessibile products, but they are not the be all and end all when it comes to accessibility.

At Code we started with introducing accessibility fundenemntals across the studio. Why is accessibility important? We did some fun little empathy excercises to get people experiencing and thinking about what it means to face barriers using the web.

## Looking internally

One of the first things we looked for was any exisiting documentation Code had around accessibility and inclusion.

We unfortunataly could not find anything, but this did give us a real opportunity to define what accessibility meant to us and do this as a collective group. We decided a couple of documents would take priority:

* Accessibility policy
* Accessibility statement

We ran an in-team half-day workshop as part of our Make Change Friday to to look at examples we liked of these documents and plan how we would approach ours, as well as thinking about what accessibility and inclusion meant to us and how we would like to communicate that.

Our accessibility policy is in the final draft stage, and as our website is currently being rebuilt, we will be making sure there is a statement on there ASAP after launch.

### Accessibility onboarding

Onboarding is an important part of any new computerlovers expereince, we do onboarding sessions to various disciplines across the studio. This now includes accessibility. This is a great win for us as it allows us to highlight and underline our accessibility culture and commitment from the start. The sessions are delivered by different champions each time, which also gives the group more expereince and confidence faciliting and talking about accessibility.

## Organisation and play to people's strengths

A benefit with having a diverse set of skills and disciplines as part of the champions is that people can contribute in ways that interest them, and play to their strengths. Anna, a delivery manager at Code has recently joined our champions network. This has led to us having much more focus and accountability in working towards our goals. 

We now have a kanban board and tickets for our goals that are broken down into different categories and from there specific, manageable tasks. Havin a delivery manager also creates a sense of us having a stakeholder, something that is helping with keeping us on track with our tickets.

A group of people with a passion for accessibility and with different skillsets is, in my opinion, more valuable than a group of accessibility experts being siloed.

## It's not all gone to plan

Whilst creating a champions group with a shared passion has been a fantastic expereince and we have shared many wins. I think it's important to aknowledge that not everything has gone to plan.

When we first set our expectations we hightlighted what some of our bloackers may be, and any change organisational and culture change is always going to be a long-term project, this is something that we were under no illusions about from the start.

### Time

With our champions not being a dedicated accessibility team (in the sense of no their primary role). Finding the time for everybody to get together and meet and push our goals forward has been a real challenge. There are dealines to hit and work to be done in our product teams, that has to take priority.

At Code we have Make Change Friday's. This is time on a Friday afternoon that we can dedicate to personal development. So this is when we have been trying to do many of our skillshares and work towards our goals.

The key has been to be consistent. So even if not everybody can make a meeting, or available to attend a skillshare, still make sure these are happening and people ahve visibility on what we are doing and when. We also record the sessions we facilitate and make notes from our meetings that are available on our comapny knowledge centre software. This ensures that even if people may not have the time to attend sessions, they can catch up.

### Budget

To help us test accessibility and understansd how people with disabilities use our products, we highlighted a few services we would like to use/partner with.

However, as many companies will know, times are hard at the moment, and these tools can often come with large yearly subscription fees. Unfortunataly that has meant us having to put these plans on hold, and re-think our timeline for being able to offer these services to our client partners.

Our job and task currently as champions is to try and find more affordable and sustainable ways to adapt to this challenge whilst including people with disabilities in the products we build.

### Remember to celebrate the wins

Whilst setbacks and blockers can be furstrating, it's important to remain positive and not let this affect the group. At the start of each one of our meetings we make sure to put some time aside to celebrate any accessibility wins or good news stories our champions have come across since the last meeting. This helps us keep focus on why we are doing what we do and realise how far we have come.
