The tech stack on my new project at work involves me working with Next.js — something I have no experience using. However, having got stuck in, there's a lovely component I've used that I thought was worth writing about — the `<Image>` component.



<div class="post-note"><h3>Mindset change</h3><p>First off I just wanted to address something from <a href="">my previous post</a>. In this post, In I mentioned about how JavaScript frameworks and such didn't really excite me. However, due to this project using React, I've started to dive into focusing on how this works. I have to say that I'm <strong>really</strong> enjoying it and this has changed my thought process on these technologies considerably.</p></div>
