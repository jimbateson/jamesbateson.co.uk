During a product lifecycle, our aim is to move accessibility considerations and conversations earlier in the process (referred to as 'shifting left'). This involves cross-discipline teams colloborating and considering peoples expereinces at each stage of the process. However, if once you ship a product, what happens if the content editors that will manage the site going forwards are external, unaware of accessibility requirements and not technically proficient. How can we ensure that our hard work in making a product accessible is not undone, or falls into a cycle of having to constantly remedy the same problems.

## Not a blame game

First off, this is defnitely not a finger pointing excerise at content editors. They often have lots of content to edit, articles to add etc on a daily basis. It may be that the tools they have to do this are not suitable, or training on these tools has not been sufficient.

There are also many content editors out there that are following accessibility best practices and upholding these standard across their teams.

The aim of this article is to look at ways we can better assist content editors in learning about and being aware of accessibility considerations when we hand over a product.
