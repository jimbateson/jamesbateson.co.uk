This maybe a bit late, but I thought I would do quick review on how things went for me in terms of work in 2019, and look forward to what I hope to acheive in 2020. This won't be useful to anybody but me, but I'm hoping it'll help me draw on some positives from 2019, and be something I can reference during 2020.

In all honesty 2019 was probably the toughest year of my life, due to things outside of work which I won't go into here, however, there are some good things I've been working on.

## Personal Site

I published this site earlier this year! I've been meaning to create myself a presence online for some time now, so I'm really pleased to have this setup.
