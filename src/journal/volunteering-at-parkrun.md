Last week due to a slight injury, I did my first volunteering role at my local Parkrun (Lancaster) - handing out finishing tokens. Volunteering is something that I had set myself a target to do this year, and it was thoroughly rewarding.

Without the volunteers that give their time up every week, no Parkrun events would be possible, so it felt great to give back some of my time. It's something that I would highly recommend, and that I will be doing again in the future.
