This week was my first following my ultramarathon training plan. I wasn't really sure what to expect, as I've never done anything like this before, always just "ran". I've actually enjoyed it a lot.

This week:

- Monday: Rest
- Tuesday: 40 mins @easy
- Wednesday: 8 miles @easy
- Thursday: Strength & conditioning
- Friday: 50 mins @easy + 10 mins @fast
- Saturday: Rest
- Sunday: 8 miles @long

## Some thoughts

I've been enjoying the easier pace of runs, not just because they are easier, but it's got me back enjoying runs and looking forward to them again.

They are taking some adjusting to though, having always just "run" with no plan at a medium-hard pace all the time, I had started to lose my way a little.

The easier miles and set rest days also seem to be helping with a few niggles I've picked up this year, having some structure and a plan is doing wonders. I'll have to have got rid of these completely a good time before the event, otherwise, it probably won't be wise for me to start. I will monitor as the plan progresses and mileage ups.

I still need to work on finding the right pace for me in terms of easy, long, marathon, tempo, and fast. However, I think this will come with time.

Roll on next week!
