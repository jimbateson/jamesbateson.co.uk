It's been far too long since I've written anything here, my last technical post, and journal update were both wayback in January! Considering one of my goals this year was to write here more frequently, I've not done too well.\

This weekend I've been making some UI tweaks and performance updates to this space, and figured it's a good time to reset a bit and try to improve my post cadence. Not saying it's going to work but worth a try.\

So going to start with this update post, quite a bit has happened in my life since those last posts, so this might seem like it's going on a bit, but it's a good chance for me to reflect as well, so bear with me! These updates are a mix of work and life.
