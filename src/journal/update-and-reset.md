It's been far too long since I've written anything here, my last technical post, and journal update were both way-back in January! Considering one of my goals this year was to write here more frequently, I've not done too well.

This weekend I've been making some UI tweaks and performance updates to this space, and figured it's a good time to reset a bit and try to improve my post cadence. Not saying it's going to work but worth a try.

So going to start with this update post, quite a bit has happened in my life since those last posts, so this might seem like it's going on a bit, but it's a good chance for me to reflect as well, so bear with me! These updates are a mix of work and life things.

## Moving (twice)
At the end of January I decided to move closer to work, and left Lancaster behind after nearly 10 years! As well as wanting to be closer to the office to better get to know the people I work with and enjoy more collaborative in-person working, it was also a chance for a fresh start with some things negatively affecting me mental health living in Lancaster.

I inititally moved to a flat near Prestwich, which was lovely. I joined a great running club and the area was baeutiful with plenty of nice green walking/running routes, and I was getting into the office more regularly.

However, the person I lived with was often out, and it felt like I was living on my own, which isn't something I wanted again after doing so for the last 5 years, I'd moved to Manchester to try and get back to being a bit more social and positive.

So I have recently moved again into a flat in Castlefield, which I absolutely love. It's a lot closer to the city centre, so I'm currently getting into the office everyday, which is ace. My flatmate is in a lot more, and even if it's just a quick chat whilst cooking or passing etc, it makes a massive difference when you're quite lonely.

When I first moved, I coudln't imagine embracing the busy city centre lifestyle, but Manchester is very much starting to feel like home now.
