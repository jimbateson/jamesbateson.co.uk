It's been far too long since I've written anything here, my last technical post, and journal update were both way-back in January! Considering one of my goals this year was to write here more frequently, I've not done too well.

This weekend I've been making some UI tweaks and performance updates to this space, and figured it's a good time to reset a bit and try to improve my post cadence. Not saying it's going to work but worth a try.

So going to start with this update post, quite a bit has happened in my life since those last posts, so this might seem like it's going on a bit, but it's a good chance for me to reflect as well, so bear with me! These updates are a mix of work and life things.

## Moving (twice)
At the end of January I decided to move closer to work, and left Lancaster behind after nearly 10 years! As well as wanting to be closer to the office to better get to know the people I work with and enjoy more collaborative in-person working, it was also a chance for a fresh start with some things negatively affecting me mental health living in Lancaster.

I initially moved to a flat near Prestwich, which was lovely. I joined a great running club and the area was baeutiful with plenty of nice green walking/running routes, and I was getting into the office more regularly.

However, the person I lived with was often out, and it felt like I was living on my own, which isn't something I wanted again after doing so for the last 5 years, I'd moved to Manchester to try and get back to being a bit more social and positive.

So I have recently moved again into a flat in Castlefield, which I absolutely love. It's a lot closer to the city center, so I'm currently getting into the office everyday, which is ace. My flatmate is in a lot more, and even if it's just a quick chat whilst cooking or passing etc, it makes a massive difference when you're quite lonely.

When I first moved, I couldn't imagine embracing the busy city center lifestyle, but Manchester is very much starting to feel like home now.

## Running
My running this year has been overall quite good. I completed my first ever ultra marathon in May when I took part in the The Lap (a full lap of Lake Windermere). Although the trianing and the even were physically and mentally tough, completing it is honestly one of the best expereinces of my life. I set myself a goal of completeing the 47 miles and ~10,000 ft of elevation in under 12 hours, and finished in 11 hours 30 minutes!

After the event, I think somewhat understandably, but also frustratingly my running has dropped off. It has been getting me a bit down that I an tell my fitness isn't what it was and the motivation and enjoyement just hasn't been there. however, the last few weeks I've started to pick things up again, feeling motivated to get out and enjoying myself again.

As mentioned when moving I joined a running club in Prestwich, which was great for meeting new people and learning some local routes. I've also joined a club local to Castlefield as well. Running can be a very lonely sort, so to have runs where I can go along, meet new people, run new routes, and just have a chat whilst doing it, is great for my mental health.

I've got no more big events planned for this year, but have a distance goal I'm working towards and a few half-marathon races coming up. I need to decide if I want to put myself through another ultra next year or just stick to marathon distance for a bit.
