Back in March I had the experience of hosting/organising my first event. The Champions of Accessibility Network (CAN), is a community network that brings together people from companies across the world with the goal of sharing experiences of running and being involved in their accessibility networks.

Whilst working at Code I offered our office at the WPP Campus in Manchester as a space for an inperson Manchester meetup!

Hosting and organising an event, is not something I have ever done previous to this, but the space Code have is lovely and I also wanted to try and give something back to a community that had inspired and supported myself when setting up the Code champions network.

In this note I just wanted to write up some tips and things to remeber for next time, as I learned a lot doing this.

## Preperation

As this was the first time organising an event, I massively underestimated the ammount of time and communication it would take to get everything needed in place, this included;

* Food and drink
* Event space booking and setup
* Estimating numbers and arranging vistor acces
* Getting all the timings right for food delivery, drink quantites, events space times
* Checking tech setups
* Ensuring the event space was suitability accessible

Some of these things I sorted in good time, but others I mistakinly thought it would be ok or even better to leave until the week before. However, this led to quite a lot of communications all at once, sometimes from 4/5 different people a day.

In future I will ensure that as much as I can do in good time is sorted.

## Kindness, empathy and honesty

A lot of the times when I was reaching out to the various people I needed to, I tried to be as polite and honest as people about the lack of experience I had doing this kind of thing.\
\
I got an amazing response from people willing to help out and also being empathetic towards the situation. Some even going the extra mile to help out.\
\
The whole expereince showed me that kindness, empathy and honesty go along with people, as does receiving it back.

## Reach out

When I first started planning and organising the event, I was trying to do it all on my own, letting things get on top of me a little and finding it quite stressful at times, I could feel myself starting to feel a little burn out, especially with regular work commintments and such on top.\
\
Reahcing out people at Code that had experience with event hosting was invaluable, I got so many tips and offers to support, even on the evening, which was lovely.\
\
I regret not reaching out earlier, as I feel it would have helped me, especially in terms of setting thigs in motion a lot sooner. I didn't want to make people feel like they had to help out, esepcially as it was an after work event.\
\
A group of people from Code even turned up for as long as they could at the event which I was grateful for.

## Don't overthink

## Try and enjoy it!
