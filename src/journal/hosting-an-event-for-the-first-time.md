Back in March I had the experience of hosting/organising my first event. The Champions of Accessibility Network (CAN), is a community network that brings together people from companies across the world with the goal of sharing experiences of running and being involved in their accessibility networks.

Whilst working at Code I offered our office at the WPP Campus in Manchester as a space for an inperson Manchester meetup!

Hosting and organising an event, is not something I have ever done previous to this, but the space Code have is lovely and I also wanted to try and give something back to a community that had inspired and supported myself when setting up the Code champions network.

In this note I just wanted to write up some tips and things to remeber for next time, as I learned a lot doing this.

## Preperation

As this was the first time organising an event, I massively underestimated the ammount of time and communication it would take to get everything needed in place, this included;

* Food and drink
* Event space booking and setup
* Estimating numbers and arranging vistor acces
* Getting all the timings right for food delivery, drink quantites, events space times
* Checking tech setups
* Ensuring the event space was suitability accessible

Some of these things I sorted in good time, but others I mistakinly thought it would be ok or even better to leave until the week before. However, this led to quite a lot of communications all at once, sometimes from 4/5 different people a day.

In future I will ensure that as much as I can do in good time is sorted.

## Kindness, empathy and honesty

A lot of the times when I was reaching out to the various people I needed to, I tried to be as polite and honest as people about the lack of experience I had doing this kind of thing.\
\
I got an amazing response from people willing to help out and also being empathetic towards the situation. Some even going the extra mile to help out.\
\
The whole expereince showed me that kindness, empathy and honesty go along with people, as does receiving it back.

## Reach out

When I first started planning and organising the event, I was trying to do it all on my own, letting things get on top of me a little and finding it quite stressful at times, I could feel myself starting to feel a little burn out, especially with regular work commintments and such on top.\
\
Reahcing out people at Code that had experience with event hosting was invaluable, I got so many tips and offers to support, even on the evening, which was lovely.\
\
I regret not reaching out earlier, as I feel it would have helped me, especially in terms of setting thigs in motion a lot sooner. I didn't want to make people feel like they had to help out, esepcially as it was an after work event.\
\
A group of people from Code even turned up for as long as they could at the event which I was grateful for.

## Don't overthink

This one was pretty difficult to be fair. Something that I'm trying to work on and not do as much of is worry/behave based on what "others" think. Due to the fact that I felt that it would be me judged if nobody turned up, or there wasn't enough food/it was unsuitable, not the right amount of drinks, the space wasn't suitable for everyone, etc I put my myself under a lot of pressure and started thinking about worst case outcomes.\
\
Worth noting that nobody made me feel like this and was never given any expecations, just my mind started going into overdrive.\
\
Hidsight is a wonderful thig, but looking back I realise that people were incredible grate just have the event to attend and a space to do that with any food/drink at all. I actually think it exceeded expectations, especially for the networks founders.

## Try and enjoy it!

this one is probably related my previous learning around overthinking. As I was so busy rushing around making sure everything was ok and thinking about timings, I don't feel I appreciated the event as much as I would have just attending. \
\
We have two amazing talks that sparked some open and interesting discussions, but in the back of my mind, I was just thinking about the event stuff.\
\
Next time, hopefully with the experiences and learning, I can enjoy it more.

## Special thanks

First to the founders of the CAN community. Heather Hepburn, Charlie Turrell and Gareth Ford WIlliams. they have created an amazing diverse, safe and open space an incredible amount of talted people to share their champions network and accessibility expereinces. They helped organise the guest list and the communication from them was great.

The large digital display in the Code office is a great draw for events like this, and at Code, Toby Burkill a lead designer has created a lot of interactive displays for welcoming clients into the office and serveral events. he put together a lovely display for the event, using CAN branding and some nice little interactive touches. IT went down brillianty and as it always is when he creates then, was a talking point and something to remember the event by (Charlie, Heather and Gareth even had pictures infront of it!).

To the people at Code that helped and supported when asked and also just offering or coming along for a bit on the night; Hannah Pickford, Gillian Lee, Stef List, Lucile Vacquie, Shilpa Chinnari, Gemma Dugdale, James Carr, Jess Sherrat, coling Preston and Toby (again).
