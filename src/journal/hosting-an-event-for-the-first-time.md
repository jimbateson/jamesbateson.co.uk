Back in March I had the experience of hosting/organising my first event. The Champions of Accessibility Network (CAN). Is a community network that brings together people from companies across the world with the goal of sharing experiences of running and being involved in their accessibility networks.

Whilst working at Code I offered our office at the WPP Campus in Manchester as a space for an inperson Manchester meetup!

Hosting and organising an event, is not something I have ever done previous to this, but the space Code have is lovely and I also wanted to try and give something back to a community that had inspired and supported myself when setting up the Code champions network.
