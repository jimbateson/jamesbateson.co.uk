Back in March I had the experience of hosting/organising my first event. The Champions of Accessibility Network (CAN), is a community network that brings together people from companies across the world with the goal of sharing experiences of running and being involved in their accessibility networks.

Whilst working at Code I offered our office at the WPP Campus in Manchester as a space for an inperson Manchester meetup!

Hosting and organising an event, is not something I have ever done previous to this, but the space Code have is lovely and I also wanted to try and give something back to a community that had inspired and supported myself when setting up the Code champions network.

In this note I just wanted to write up some tips and things to remeber for next time, as I learned a lot doing this.

1. Preperation
2. Kindness, empathy and honesty
3. Reach out
4. Don't overthink
5. Try and enjoy it!

## Special thanks
