about: >-
  I've been working as a front-end developer now for 6 years and very much see
  myself being on the 'front of the frontend' I love trying to recreate
  UI's/print layouts I see on and offline with CSS and HTML.


  I've been working at Fat Media now for the duration of my development career
  and live and work in Lancaster.
