# jamesbateson.co.uk

The personal website of James Bateson. A 28 front-end developer based in Lancaster and working at Fat Media.

The site is currently in very very early stages of development, so expect lots of updates and posisbly re-builds when I start hating something!

One of my main reasons for building this site, is to try and write more. Whether it be articles on tech, life, health etc.

I also want to use it as a space to experiment with techniques that perhaps we don't get to use at work. Therefore I'll be adding a demos section. This is more to build full page demos, I have started to use codepen for proof of concept and smaller demos.

## Roadmap

* Lazyload
* Demos section
* Gradient toggle
* About me section
* Projects section
* Contact form
* Content update
* Add some journal articles
* Checks (accessibility, performance, cross browser, cross device ect)
