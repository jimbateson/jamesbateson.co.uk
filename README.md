# jamesbateson.co.uk

The personal website of James Bateson. A front-end developer based in Lancaster and working at Fat Media.

One of my main reasons for building this site, is to try and write more. Whether it be articles on tech, life, health, etc.

I also want to use it as a space to experiment with techniques that perhaps we don't get to use at work. Therefore I'll be adding a demos section. This is more to build full page demos, I have started to use codepen for proof of concept and smaller demos.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Lazyload [~~native~~][hybrid]
- [ ] Demos section
- [x] ~~Dark mode toggle~~
- [ ] Contact form
- [ ] Responsive image solution
- [ ] Proper font loading solution
